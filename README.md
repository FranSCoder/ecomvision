# [Admin Dashboard](https://admin-frontend-3yrt.onrender.com) - Manage your e-commerce

## Prior considerations :thinking:

* This project has a mere educational motivation, therefore, I chose the free-tier Render.com servers to deploy it, which have the downside of shutting down after 15 minutes of inactivity. Hence, I ask for a little bit of patience when first loading the application, since it could take about 30 seconds to load (it works normally after the first load).
* All data managed by this educational app is mock data, no one's privacy has been violated during its development and showcase.

## What is it about? :bulb:

Ecomvision Admin Dashboard is a solution that provides a great spectrum of data related to e-commerce's products, sales, transactions and affiliates with several tools to ease data visualization. These tools include line graphs, pie charts, tables and even a world map to show the whereabouts of our clients. All data is located in a MongoDB collection.

## How does it work? :gear:

Just access the application and navigate through the left panel to visualize all the data.

## Options :wrench:

The app includes dark and light mode options.
